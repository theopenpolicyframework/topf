# What is The Open Policy Framework?

Writing policies can be hard, writing good policies can be even harder. Policies often take on a life of their own, sometimes spanning multiple pages which not only include the policy, but the standard and procedure as well. Finding what is needed in a lengthy policy, especially in a time of crisis can be hectic. The Open Policy Framework was formed to help with this very important task. 

The Open Policy Framework depicts formalizing a proper policy, standard, and procedure. Structuring the documents in a framework making them easy to read and most importantly, find the information you are looking for. The project is free and open source, allowing anyone to contribute and use the documents within their own organization.
