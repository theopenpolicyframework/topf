## Purpose
Establish information security governance within the organization.


## Owner
- Department of Information Security

## Scope
All organization personnel and trusted third parties who receive, store, process, or transmit data.


## Policy

It is the organizations responsibility to protect the data, information systems, and related services. To ensure that systems which receive, store, process, or transmit are adequately protected, all organization personnel and trusted third parties must follow all policies, standards, and procedures. This includes protecting against intentional or accidental degradation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and information systems. 

#### Confidentiality
Limiting access of information to those individuals, or entities, which require access in order to perform their job functions. This includes implementing safeguards in order to prevent accidental or unauthorized disclosure of confidential or restricted information.

#### Integrity
Ensuring information has not been altered, changed or deleted accidently or deliberately by unauthorized individuals. Information systems and resources must be configured to adequately protect data either in flight or at rest.

#### Availability
Timely access to information is critical for business functions and availability of systems and resources are key. IT systems and resources must be architected and configured to ensure access to information fall within business continuity planning guidelines.

#### Data Protection
To further mitigate risk of compromise to sensitive Information, data which has been classified as confidential or restricted, is required to be encrypted both in flight and at rest. Examples include:

Data in flight:
- Email
- File transfer
- Authentication to remote systems

Data at rest:
- Hard drives
- Optical media - CD/DVD/Blue-Ray
- External storage devices - USB thumb drives, external hard drives, mobile phones

Data in motion:
- Informaiton which is actively used by running applications or processes

#### Malware Protections
Devices that have the ability to communicate across a network should have antimalware protections installed and running. If a particular device which can communicate across a network and cannot have antimalware protections installed must be placed on a separate network segment with a device that filters traffic to and from that device.

#### Non-Person Entities
Non-person entities are defined as client-to-server or server-to-server communication. NPE’s shall communicate over an encrypted tunnel utilizing symmetric, asymmetric, token based, and/or one-way hash.

#### Roles and Responsibilities
Data Owner:
The data owner is the entity or organization is the party who is responsible for ensuring data is safeguarded and meet all legal and regulatory requirements. Data owners are also responsible for establishing policies and standards to protect information from unauthorized access and disclosure.

Data Custodian:
The data custodian is an individual, or entity, who has control over a resource which stores or transmits information. It is the data custodian’s responsibility to safeguard information by ensuring those resources follow all policies, standards, and procedures set forth by the data owner.

#### System Protections
Following the pricipal of least privilege, all personnel are to only be given enough rights to a given information system for them to do their job and no more. 

#### Vulnerability Detection and Mitigation
Devices which are assigned either a physical or logical address and communicate on a network must be scanned for vulnerabilities. Once a vulnerability has been detected, that vulnerability must be fixed and the system brought back to normal operations. Examples of a physical or logical address includes:

Devices:
- Information systems
- Internet of Things or IoT
- Smart devices
- Laptop or desktop computers

Physical:
- Media Access Control or MAC address

Logical
- IPv4 or IPv6 address
