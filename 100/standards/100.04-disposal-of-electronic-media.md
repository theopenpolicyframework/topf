  + The wiping utility must follow the guidelines presented in the Department of Defense's 5220.22-M wipe method
    * Writes zero bytes (0x00) or 0
    * Writes high bytes (0xFF) or 1
    * Writes pseudo-random bytes
    * Verification checks
- Solid state drives
  + Use of crypto shredding
    * Entire solid state drive is encrypted using AES 256
    * Use of an encryption key at or exceeding 32 characters which include upper case, lower case, numbers, and special characters
