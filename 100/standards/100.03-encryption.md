## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to standardize on appropriate encryption strengths and algorithms used by the organization. Data owners must dictate the strength of the encryption being used to properly protect data which is retrieved, produced, stored, and transmitted. This determination is provided by the Data Classification standard. 

## Owner
- Department of Information Security

## Scope
All organization personnel, trusted third parties, and non-person entities.

## Standard

#### Acceptable Encryption Algorithms and Bit Strengths
- Asymmetric keys
  + ECC: 256 - 521 (Preferred)
  + RSA: 2048 - 4096
- Symmetric keys
  + AES: 128 - 256
- Hash
  + SHA-2 which include SHA-224 through SHA-512
  + SHA-3 which include SHA3-224 through SHA3-512
- Session encryption
  + Transport layer encryption (TLS) version 1.2 or higher
- Secure shell (SSH)
  + Protocol 2 or later
- Wireless connectivity
  + Guest wireless - WPA2-PSK (AES)
  + Personnel wireless - WPA2 enterprise with 802.1x authentication
- Code signing
  + All code must be cryptographically signed
  + Public facing code must be signed by a valid certificate authority
  + Internal facing code must be signed by either a valid certificate authority or can be self-signed

#### Additional Requirements
- The transmission unencrypted data across a public network such as the internet is strictly prohibited
- The use of low or weak ciphers must be disabled on all information systems
  + This includes:
    * All versions of SSL, TLS v1.0 and 1.1
    * MD5 or SHA1
- Keys must be unique when generating or regenerating cryptographic keys
