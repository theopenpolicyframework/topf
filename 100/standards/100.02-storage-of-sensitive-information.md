## Purpose
This document is to establish a organizational wide standard for the protection of sensitive information which is stored and/or shared in physical or electronic formats. The objective of this standard is to minimize the likelihood that any sensitive information is inadvertantly disclosed.

## Owner
- Department of Information Security

## Scope
All organizational personnel, trusted third parties or customers who are allowed to conduct business on behalf of the organization.

## Standard
#### Storage
- Sensitive information shall not be stored on a privately-owned device or personally removable media.
- Sensitive information must be encrypted at rest in accordance to the organization's encryption standard.
- The organization maintains a clean desk policy where documents should be removed from your desk when not in use or at the end of day.

#### Data Disposal or Destruction of Digital Media
- Do not return failed hard drive to vendors for warranty repair or replacement until after the drive is destroyed. In instances where the vendor is responsible for the removal of the deivce, the vendor must certify the drive will be destroyed in a way that the data is rendered unrecoverable. Proof of such destruction shall be pressented upon request.
- Hard copies or physical documents which contain printed sensitive information must be destroyed in such a manner which makes it impossible to reconstruct the original document.
- All electronic media must follow the Disposal of Electronic Media standard.

#### Transfer
- Do not mail or courier sensitive information on optical or removable media unless it is encrypted.
- Individuals are prohibited from transmitting any sensitive information through unsecure email or through the use of clear text protocols. In the event either of these are the only modes of transmission, the contents must be encrypted using secure Zip files and password protected.

#### Trusted Third Party Usage
- The storage of sensitive information on free or personal cloud storage providers is strictly prohibited. Information can only be stored in organizational approved third party applications.
- Access to sensitive information from trusted third parties must follow least privilege and separation of duties. This is to only allow access to information for which is required to perform their job functions and no more.
- Data owners must have the necessary contract language, and have it approved to protect sensitive information.
